What else could I say?</p>
Everyone is gay</p>
What else could I write?</p>
I don't have the right
What else should I be?</p>
All apologies
In the sun
In the sun, I feel as one</p>
In the sun

      <h2>All Apologies</h2>
      <p>I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
</p>
Aqua sea foam shame</p>
Sunburn freezer burn</p>
Choking on the ashes of her enemy</p>
In the sun</p>
In the sun, I feel as one
In the sun</p>
In the sun
Married
Married
Married
Buried
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All in all is all we are.</p>
